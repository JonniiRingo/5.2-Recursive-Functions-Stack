Lesson 5.2: Recursive Function Calls and the Call Stack

Concept Overview:
In Lesson 5.1, we introduced the concept of recursion. In this lesson, we will explore how recursive 
function calls work and how they are managed by the call stack. Understanding the call stack is crucial 
for preventing stack overflow errors and writing efficient recursive code.

Key Terminology:
Call stack
Function call frame
Stack overflow
Tail recursion
